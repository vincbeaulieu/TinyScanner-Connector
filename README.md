# TinyScanner-Connector
 Application designed to dump previously scanned pdf from an old iPad iOS 9.3.5 having the Tiny Scanner+ v4.1.1 application. Since I've previously paid for that app before they decided to make it a monthly payment, I've decided to recycle my old iPad to scan PDF during the Covid pandemic. I've been doing it using a bash script, but I've decided to give it a refresh and make and actual MacOS application.
